## Project Status

I will not be adding features to this project, but will try and update the UI/frontend to reflect my current skill levels, as it is a little dated and not as efficient as I would like.

## Description

A Rest API built with node.js, mongo and express powering this app, to be able to perform any sort of CRUD operations. Frontend with react and redux with thunk to handle data management. JWT for authentication, private routes to prevent unauthorized access.

## Tech/Framework Used

- Node.js
- React
- Mongo
- Express
- JWT
- Redux
- Sass

## Motivation

I built this to be able to get familiar with node and the backend. The backend design was part of a course I learnt in Udemy. I wanted to have an app that can perform CRUD operations and also have an external database like Mongo and try out new auth flows like JWT. This was a very good learning experience.
